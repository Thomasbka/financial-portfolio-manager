## Overview
A financial portfolio manager that allows users to add, edit and track their stock investments. Users can fetch live prices, see profit/loss, and track dividends over time.
The user also has access to a sentiment analysis tool that gives an overall analysis of the market sentiment of a stock as well as the stock's confidence level. This analysis is based on the live financial articles. It also includes a little section that explains the key reasons for this.

## Technologies Used
* **Front End:** React, Webpack, Javascript(ES6+), SCSS
* **Back End:** Ruby on Rails (6.1+), PostgreSQL (in production)
* **Hosting:** Heroku
* **APIs:**
  * Aplhpa Vantage for live stock data
  * Sentiment Analysis API (created in python using FastAPI)

## Approach
1. **Planning & Wireframing:**
  - Sketched out user flows and key interfaces.
2. **Data Modeling:** 
  - Defined how Positions, Trades, and Dividends would relate in the database.
3. **API Integration:** 
  - Integrated Alpha Vantage to fetch live stock prices and symbol suggestions as well as my own Sentiment Tool API.
4. **Front-End Layout & Responsiveness:**
  - Built React components with conditional rendering for mobile vs. desktop.
5. **Testing & Iteration:** 
  - Used local environment and deployed frequently to Heroku for QA.
